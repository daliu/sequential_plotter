# sequential_plotter
A matplotlib sequential plotter for data.

This is a simple plotter that allows an individual to plot multiple histograms sequentially, but not simultaneously.
Make sure you have all libraries that are imported.
Load the first line with the names of your features in a list.
Load the second line with all your numeric data in a list of lists.
Follow the input instructions.
Have fun, and I hope this helps.
